# Deployment Verification

## Current Status
- ✅ Local build works (dist/ folder exists with assets)
- ✅ Built index.html has correct paths
- ❌ GitHub Pages shows blank page
- ❌ Console shows TypeScript loading errors

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings
- Go to: https://github.com/dakshgehlot/wa-embedded-signup-flow/settings/pages
- Source should be: "Deploy from a branch"
- Branch should be: "gh-pages"
- Folder should be: "/ (root)"

### 2. Check GitHub Actions
- Go to: https://github.com/dakshgehlot/wa-embedded-signup-flow/actions
- Look for the latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
- Check if it completed successfully

### 3. Check gh-pages Branch
- Go to: https://github.com/dakshgehlot/wa-embedded-signup-flow/tree/gh-pages
- Should contain: index.html, 404.html, assets/ folder

### 4. Force New Deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add .nojekyll and fix deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Manual Deployment (if needed)
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Expected Files in gh-pages Branch
- index.html
- 404.html
- .nojekyll
- assets/index-*.js
- assets/index-*.css
- favicon.ico
- netcore-logo.svg
- placeholder.svg
- robots.txt
